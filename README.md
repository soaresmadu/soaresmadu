I’m a fullstack developer, passionate about technology, dedicated, and always eager to learn more. I’m constantly seeking new knowledge and challenges that help me grow as a professional in the development field. Currently, I work with technologies like React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, .NET, C#, and MySQL, always aiming to apply best practices such as SOLID principles, Clean Code, and Git version control.
